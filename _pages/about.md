I am a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, working at the intersection of NLP and biomedicine under the guidance of Professors Li Shen and Mark Yatskar. 

My primary research goal is to establish a **scientific account of how LLMs acquire, store, and reason with knowledge**. Through controlled experiments, I'm investigating the causal factors behind model capabilities, specifically how natural language teaches knowledge, reasoning, and enables out-of-distribution generalization. This is rooted in a conviction that research trends, policy decisions, and societal sentiment require a far more scientific understanding of LLMs. 

Simultaneously, I'm applying these findings to **biomedicine**, where robustness and safety are critical. My work in this space spans from leveraging LLMs as knowledge priors in genetics to bridging the modality gap between text and molecular representations.
